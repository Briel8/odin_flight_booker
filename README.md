# Flight Booker

In this project, I'll create a booking system for a one-way flight, handling more advanced 
forms and form submissions. The process will involve:
1. Searching for flights.
2. Choosing from available flights.
3. Entering passenger information.

This project will provide practice with:
1. dropdown 
2. menus
3. radio buttons and
4. nested forms.
